# **AI Algorithms & Mathematics â€“ Assignment 2**
This repository contains my solutions for **AIDI 1000 â€“ AI Algorithms & Mathematics Assignment 2**. The assignment focuses on **statistical hypothesis testing, optimization techniques, linear algebra, and eigenvalue computations** using Python.

---

## **ðŸ“Œ Assignment Overview**
The assignment includes four key mathematical and algorithmic problems:
- **One-Sample Right-Tailed t-Test**
- **Gradient Descent Optimization**
- **Matrix Multiplication and Identity Properties**
- **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of Matrices**

Each problem includes **Python implementations, numerical results, and interpretations**.

---

## **ðŸ“˜ Example Solution Format**
Each solution consists of:
1. **Problem Statement** â€“ Briefly describes the mathematical problem.
2. **Methodology** â€“ Outlines the approach taken (e.g., t-test, gradient descent, matrix operations).
3. **Python Code** â€“ Implementation using NumPy and SciPy.
4. **Results & Interpretation** â€“ Includes computed values and conclusions.

### **Example: One-Sample t-Test (Right-Tailed)**
```markdown
Sample size (n):           31
Sample mean:               1.0645
Sample standard deviation: 0.0755
t-statistic:               4.7583
One-sided p-value:         0.000023
Significance level:        0.05
Reject H0?:                True

Conclusion: I reject H0 (mean mercury > 1).
95% Confidence Interval: [1.0368, 1.0922]
